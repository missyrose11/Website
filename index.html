  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>Hadih, my name is Melissa Thomas and I am from Saik'uz First Nation  (Dakleh Territory, Dakelh means people who "travel upon water"). I am a member of the Lhts'umusyoo (Grouse) Clan. My Atsiyan and Atsoo (Grandpa and Grandma) are the late Peter Thomas Sr. and the late Matilda Thomas.</p>
  <p>This my website about my community. Saik'uz First Nation is a community of approximately 400 with an additional 600 members living throughout British Columbia and Canada. Its traditional territory is located near the geographical centre of BC, with the leading community situated on the east end of Nulki Lake, 14 kilometres south of the town of Vanderhoof. A member of the greater Dakelh (Carrier) Nation, Saik'uz derives its name from the Dakelh word meaning "on the sand", which refers to the sandy soil on which the main community is settled. Saik'uz has a rich tradition of trapping, hunting, fishing, and medicine, and is currently working to revitalize its language in-community and to develop sustainable economic and cultural growth.</p>

  <p>Once, there were no lakes and rivers.  There was no Necha-Koh, and only one village, Chunlac.  Our elders at Sai-K’uz tell us this is where ‘Utas was born.  As a child, he ran off with his Grandfather’s bowl containing all of the water in the world.  When the bowl tumbled and broke, ‘Utas splashed the water with his hands, creating the lakes, creeks, and rivers.</p>
